## Project Motivation <a name="mt"></a>
I have used some resources in the past whiles working on project and I have some bookmarked. But I thought it will be great make those resources public so others can have access to them as well. They were really helpful resources and I believe it will go a long way to help others as well.

I had the inspiration from this [blog post](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-not-to-be-overwhelmed-with-data-science-5a95ff1618f8) on Towards Data Science and [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/julianikulski/data-science-resources)
